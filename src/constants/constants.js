    title: 'Stable Matching Problem (Java)',
    description:"As part of my object-oriented programming course, I built a command-line application in Java that solves the stable matching problem using the Gale-Shapley algorithm. The algorithm takes in formatted datasets for suitors and receivers and matches them in an optimal way. A matching is stable when there is no pair (A, B) where both participants prefer each other to their matched partners.",
